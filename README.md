# tug-of-war
This was a brief given to me near the beginning of the _nology course. 
The brief was an introudction to JavaScript. 
The brief stated that it was to be built in one file, and show a tug of war game where the players scores are counted. 

I have set the Tug left to be left arrow and right to be right arrow. 

Enjoy !
